# Spirolateral

This is a simple program to draw and display Spirolaterals, originally inspired by an old Martin Gardener Mathematical Games column. This page offers a nice explanation of them:

I basically used this to try out the Haxe language. Lots of features could be added.
This project was compiled with [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/)
I got the best performance is using the HTML5 target:
`>openfl test html5`

Clicking once causes the shape to start rotating, clicking again draws another random Spirolateral.
