# Spirolateral

This is a simple program to draw and display Spirolaterals: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Spirolateral.html
Basically used to try out the Haxe language. Lots of features could be added.
This project was compiled with OpenFL (http://www.openfl.org/)
The best performance is using the HTML5 target:
>openfl test html5
